        <h1>My Notes on the History of Computing</h1>
        <h2>By Joel Strandburg</h2>
        <p>
            Recently I've found a some good resources detailing some of the history of topics like unix, <br>
            Python, computer hardware, etc.  I decided to create this site in order to try and share this information.

        <h2>UNIX</h2>
        <p>
            In the mid-1960's MIT, Bell Labs (AT&amp;T), and General Electric (surprisingly made computer hardware) were working <br>
            on creating a system called Multics.  Multics was a time-sharing operating system for the <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE-600_series" target="_blank">GE-645</a> mainframe computer.  There was frustration about the progress of this project <br> 
            so many Bell Labs personal left the project.  Bell labs was still interested in this type of <br>
            system so the lab worked to create a different system (<a href="https://youtu.be/tc4ROCJYbm0?si=DsUbeZKAYS0MRuRn" target="_blank">Check out this old archive from AT&amp;T</a>).  They named this system Unix which was a pun on Multics.  This operating system <br>
            originally written in <a href="https://youtu.be/4gwYkEK0gOk?si=Vzde5ndIgN7hr0PY" target="_blank">assembly language</a> for the <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11" target="_blank">PDP-11</a>.  In 1973, Unix was rewritten in C.
